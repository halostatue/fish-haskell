# halostatue/fish-haskell

A plugin for [fish shell][] to enable Haskell programs. By default, this will
check for `$HOME/.cabal/bin` (to support programs installed with
`cabal-install`) and `$HOME/.local/bin` (to support programs installed with
`stack`) in `$PATH` and `$fish_user_paths` and add them to `$fish_user_paths`
if missing.

If `~/.ghcup/env` exists, the _effects_ of `~/.ghcup/env` will be applied to
`$fish_user_paths` if not already present in `$PATH` or `$fish_user_paths`.
Neither [bass][] nor [bax][] is used for this.
